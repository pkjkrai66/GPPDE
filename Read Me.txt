Code demonstrates application of GPPDE on diffusion/heat equation and the Richards equation
These codes could be used to reproduce the results and figures provided in my thesis.
The codes are tested on Matlab R2016b and R2018a.

For Diffusion/heat equation Run the following:
\Heat Equation > GPSoln_Heat

For Richards equation Run the following:
\Richards Equation > GPSoln_Richard
