# GPPDE
Code demonstrates application of GPPDE method on diffusion/heat equation and the Richards equation. These codes could be used to reproduce the results and figures provided in my thesis.
The codes are tested on Matlab R2016b and R2018a.

For Diffusion/heat equation Run the following:
\Heat Equation > GPSoln_Heat

For Richards equation Run the following:
\Richards Equation > GPSoln_Richard

The proposed is a new collocation method for estimating parameters of a partial differential equation (PDE), which uses Gaussian process (GP) as a basis function and is termed as Gaussian process for partial differential equation (GPPDE).
